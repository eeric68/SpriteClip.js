    Changelog:
    1.0.6
        - In 1.06, all background-positions are cached on instantiation, so we don't need to calculate before entering a new frame. This dramatically increases performance. Inspired by Jeremy Petrequin's jsMovieclip.
    1.0.5
        - Now, when events are dispatched, a reference to the instance is passed along
    1.0.4
        - Fixed demos so they work with the new project architecture - also updated to jQuery 1.9.1
        - Added AMD factory
        - Moved SpriteClipEvent so it is no longer global. It is now a static member of SpriteClip and is accessed via SpriteClip.Event.ENTER_FRAME, SpriteClip.Event.PLAYING etc. 
        - Removed docs as the output was ugly - will replace with another doc library once researched
    1.0.3
        - Split the project into seperate classes
        - Added grunt to build the project - To begin with uglification, concatenation and jsdoc3 - see docs folder for documentation
    1.0.2
        - Renamed SpriteClipEvent.PLAY and SpriteClipEvent.STOP to .PLAYING and .STOPPED and made sure that they are dispatched like so:
          STOPPED: when a clip is stopped completely or when a playing clip is told to play in a different direction
          PLAYING: when a clip that isnt playing starts to play - including when a playing clip is told to play in a different direction
        - Rewrote a lot of comments

    1.0.1
        - Changed rewindToAndStop method name to rewindtoAndStop for case consistency (like as3 gotoAndStop)
        - Changed playToAndStop method name to playtoAndStop for case consistency (like as3 gotoAndStop)
        - Added a public read only property for layout - either "horizontal" or "vertical" that matches what was passed in via settings
        - Added event types PLAY and STOP that are dispatched when play() and stop() are called
